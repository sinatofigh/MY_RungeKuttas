# MY_RungeKuttas

I know this is not an achievement to brag about or share with others. My purpose of sharing it is to see why my 
fourth order RungeKutta produces a smoother solution than Scipy's solve_ivp. Scipy's solution in 2nd order looks fine,
but in fourth order looks a lot bumpier than mine.
